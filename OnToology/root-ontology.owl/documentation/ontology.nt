This ensures its arrival at the correct destination. To achieve this, the network device must match a destination Layer 3 address with the correct Layer 2 address using either static or dynamic maps. In a dynamic environment, the mapping of Layer 2 and Layer 3 information can fail because devices may have been specifically configured not to respond to ARP or Inverse-ARP requests, the Layer 2 or Layer 3 information that is cached may have physically changed, or invalid ARP replies are received because of a misconfiguration or a security attack." .

<urn:absolute://local/storage-reliability-ontology#ApplicationLayerProblem> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Most of the application layer protocols provide user services. Application layer protocols are typically used for network management, file transfer, distributed file services, terminal emulation, and email. New user services are often added, such as VPNs and VoIP.\n\nThe figure shows the most widely known and implemented TCP/IP application layer protocols include:\n\nSSH/Telnet - Enables users to establish terminal session connections with remote hosts.\nHTTP - Supports the exchanging of text, graphic images, sound, video, and other multimedia files on the web.\nFTP - Performs interactive file transfers between hosts.\nTFTP - Performs basic interactive file transfers typically between hosts and networking devices.\nSMTP - Supports basic message delivery services.\nPOP - Connects to mail servers and downloads email.\nSimple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) - Collects management information from network devices.\nDNS - Maps IP addresses to the names assigned to network devices.\nNetwork File System (NFS) - Enables computers to mount drives on remote hosts and operate them as if they were local drives. Originally developed by Sun Microsystems, it combines with two other application layer protocols, external data representation (XDR) and remote-procedure call (RPC), to allow transparent access to remote network resources.\nThe types of symptoms and causes depend upon the actual application itself.\n\nApplication layer problems prevent services from being provided to application programs. A problem at the application layer can result in unreachable or unusable resources when the physical, data link, network, and transport layers are functional. It is possible to have full network connectivity, but the application simply cannot provide data.\n\nAnother type of problem at the application layer occurs when the physical, data link, network, and transport layers are functional, but the data transfer and requests for network services from a single network service or application do not meet the normal expectations of a user.\n\nA problem at the application layer may cause users to complain that the network or the particular application that they are working with is sluggish or slower than usual when transferring data or requesting network services" .

<urn:absolute://local/storage-reliability-ontology#CablingFault> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Cable conditions such as opens, kinks, crimps, sharp bends, and broken connectors or adapters, as well as loose screws, are common physical problems. You can discover some physical problems by visual inspection, whereas others require you to use tools, such as cable testers. Link LEDs are good indicators of link status. When in doubt, replace a suspicious cable with a known/good one for testing." .

<urn:absolute://local/storage-reliability-ontology#DuplexNegotiationFail> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Another common cause for interface errors is a mismatched duplex mode between two ends of an Ethernet link. In many Ethernet-based networks, point-to-point connections are now the norm, and the use of hubs and the associated half-duplex operation is becoming less common. This means that most Ethernet links today operate in full-duplex mode, and while collisions were seen as normal for an Ethernet link, collisions today often indicate that duplex negotiation has failed, and the link is not operating in the correct duplex mode.\n\nThe IEEE 802.3ab Gigabit Ethernet standard mandates the use of autonegotiation for speed and duplex. In addition, although it is not strictly mandatory, practically all Fast Ethernet NICs also use autonegotiation by default. The use of autonegotiation for speed and duplex is the current recommended practice. Duplex configuration guidelines are listed in Figure 1.\n\nHowever, if duplex negotiation fails for some reason, it might be necessary to set the speed and duplex manually on both ends. Typically, this would mean setting the duplex mode to full-duplex on both ends of the connection. However, if this does not work, running half-duplex on both ends is preferred over a duplex mismatch." .

<urn:absolute://local/storage-reliability-ontology#FramingProblem> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Frames usually work in groups of 8-bit bytes. A framing error occurs when a frame does not end on an 8-bit byte boundary. When this happens, the receiver may have problems determining where one frame ends and another frame starts. Too many invalid frames may prevent valid keepalives from being exchanged. Framing errors can be caused by a noisy serial line, an improperly designed cable (too long or not properly shielded), or an incorrectly configured channel service unit (CSU) line clock." .

<urn:absolute://local/storage-reliability-ontology#NATIssues> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "There are a number of problems with NAT such as not interacting with services like DHCP and tunneling. These can include misconfigured NAT inside, NAT outside, or ACL. Other issues include interoperability with other network technologies, especially those that contain or derive information from host network addressing in the packet. Some of these technologies include:\n\nBOOTP and DHCP - Both protocols manage the automatic assignment of IPv4 addresses to clients. Recall that the first packet that a new client sends is a DHCP-Request broadcast IPv4 packet. The DHCP-Request packet has a source IPv4 address of 0.0.0.0. Because NAT requires both a valid destination and source IPv4 address, BOOTP and DHCP can have difficulty operating over a router running either static or dynamic NAT. Configuring the IPv4 helper feature can help solve this problem.\nDNS and WINS - Because a router running dynamic NAT is changing the relationship between inside and outside addresses regularly as table entries expire and are recreated, a DNS or WINS server outside the NAT router does not have an accurate representation of the network inside the router. Configuring the IPv4 helper feature can help solve this problem.\nSNMP - Similar to DNS packets, NAT is unable to alter the addressing information stored in the data payload of the packet. Because of this, an SNMP management station on one side of a NAT router may not be able to contact SNMP agents on the other side of the NAT router. Configuring the IPv4 helper feature can help solve this problem.\nTunneling and encryption protocols - Encryption and tunneling protocols often require that traffic be sourced from a specific UDP or TCP port, or use a protocol at the transport layer that cannot be processed by NAT. For example, IPsec tunneling protocols and generic routing encapsulation protocols used by VPN implementations cannot be processed by NAT.\nNote: DHCPv6 from an IPv6 client can be forwarded by the router using the ipv6 dhcp relay command." .

<urn:absolute://local/storage-reliability-ontology#OutputQueueDrops> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Output queue drops - Output queue drops indicate that packets were dropped due to congestion on the interface. Seeing output drops is normal for any point where the aggregate input traffic is higher than the output traffic. During traffic peaks, packets are dropped if traffic is delivered to the interface faster than it can be sent out. However, even if this is considered normal behavior, it leads to packet drops and queuing delays, so applications that are sensitive to those, such as VoIP, might suffer from performance issues. Consistently seeing output drops can be an indicator that you need to implement an advanced queuing mechanism to provide good QoS to each application." .

Uncommon protocols that are gaining popularity are VPN and encryption protocols.\nThe log keyword is a useful command for viewing ACL operation on ACL entries. This keyword instructs the router to place an entry in the system log whenever that entry condition is matched. The logged event includes details of the packet that matched the ACL element. The log keyword is especially useful for troubleshooting and also provides information on intrusion attempts being blocked by the ACL." .

<urn:absolute://local/storage-reliability-ontology#RoutingProblem> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Common symptoms of network problems at the network layer include:\n\nNetwork failure - Network failure is when the network is nearly or completely non-functional, affecting all users and applications on the network. These failures are usually noticed quickly by users and network administrators, and are obviously critical to the productivity of a company.\nSuboptimal performance - Network optimization problems usually involve a subset of users, applications, destinations, or a particular type of traffic. Optimization issues can be difficult to detect and even harder to isolate and diagnose. This is because they usually involve multiple layers, or even the host computer itself. Determining that the problem is a network layer problem can take time.\nIn most networks, static routes are used in combination with dynamic routing protocols. Improper configuration of static routes can lead to less than optimal routing. In some cases, improperly configured static routes can create routing loops which make parts of the network unreachable.\n\nTroubleshooting dynamic routing protocols requires a thorough understanding of how the specific routing protocol functions. Some problems are common to all routing protocols, while other problems are particular to the individual routing protocol.\n\nThere is no single template for solving Layer 3 problems. Routing problems are solved with a methodical process, using a series of commands to isolate and diagnose the problem.\n\nHere are some areas to explore when diagnosing a possible problem involving routing protocols:\n\nGeneral network issues - Often a change in the topology, such as a down link, may have effects on other areas of the network that might not be obvious at the time. This may include the installation of new routes, static or dynamic, or removal of other routes. Determine whether anything in the network has recently changed, and if there is anyone currently working on the network infrastructure.\nConnectivity issues - Check for any equipment and connectivity problems, including power problems such as outages and environmental problems (for example, overheating). Also check for Layer 1 problems, such as cabling problems, bad ports, and ISP problems.\nNeighbor issues - If the routing protocol establishes an adjacency with a neighbor, check to see if there are any problems with the routers forming neighbor adjacencies.\nTopology database - If the routing protocol uses a topology table or database, check the table for anything unexpected, such as missing entries or unexpected entries.\nRouting table - Check the routing table for anything unexpected, such as missing routes or unexpected routes. Use debug commands to view routing updates and routing table maintenance." .

<urn:absolute://local/storage-reliability-ontology#STPLoop> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The purpose of the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is to resolve a redundant physical topology into a tree-like topology by blocking redundant ports. Most STP problems are related to forwarding loops that occur when no ports in a redundant topology are blocked and traffic is forwarded in circles indefinitely, excessive flooding because of a high rate of STP topology changes. A topology change should be a rare event in a well-configured network. When a link between two switches goes up or down, there is eventually a topology change when the STP state of the port is changing to or from forwarding. However, when a port is flapping (oscillating between up and down states), this causes repetitive topology changes and flooding, or slow STP convergence or re-convergence. This can be caused by a mismatch between the real and documented topology, a configuration error, such as an inconsistent configuration of STP timers, an overloaded switch CPU during convergence, or a software defect." .

<urn:absolute://local/storage-reliability-ontology#WrongOrderOfAccessControlEntries> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Order of access control entries - The entries in an ACL should be from specific to general. Although an ACL may have an entry to specifically permit a particular traffic flow, packets never match that entry if they are being denied by another entry earlier in the list. If the router is running both ACLs and NAT, the order in which each of these technologies is applied to a traffic flow is important. Inbound traffic is processed by the inbound ACL before being processed by outside-to-inside NAT. Outbound traffic is processed by the outbound ACL after being processed by inside-to-outside NAT." .

<urn:absolute://local/storage-reliability-ontology#WrongSelectionOfTransportLayerProtocol> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Selection of transport layer protocol - When configuring ACLs, it is important that only the correct transport layer protocols be specified. Many network administrators, when unsure whether a particular traffic flow uses a TCP port or a UDP port, configure both. Specifying both opens a hole through the firewall, possibly giving intruders an avenue into the network. It also introduces an extra element into the ACL, so the ACL takes longer to process, introducing more latency into network communications." .
